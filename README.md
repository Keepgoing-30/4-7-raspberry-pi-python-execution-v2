This program uses a Raspberry Pi to trigger a "Someone has pressed the alert button!" message when a physical button is pressed. The process involves writing and testing the script in GitHub Codespaces, pushing it to a repository, and then using SSH to securely clone and run the code directly on the Raspberry Pi's hardware.
